# Cyber Kill Chain

## Intro

The Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain, is a framework for identification and prevention of cyber intrusion activity. The model identifies what attackers must complete in order to achieve their objectives. You can find out more[ here](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html).

The Kill chain has 7 steps:

1. Reconnaissance - Harvesting email addresses, conference information, etc.
2. Weaponization - Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload.
3. Delivery - Delivering weaponized bundle to the victim via email, web, USB, etc.
4. Exploitation - Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on a victim's system.
5. Installation - Installing malware on the asset.
6. Command & Control - Command channel for remote manipulation of the victim.
7. Actions on Objectives - Attackers have desired access and can now accomplish their original goals.
