* Date Read: January 2022
* Note: A quick, short read that gives an insight into the roles of the SOC and the wider security team in various types of organisation. This book serves to give prospective security analysts an idea of what to expect when starting their first SOC role and gives a list of fundamental skills that can be developed to land this sort of role. This book is a high level and won't teach you all the skills you need to get a SOC analyst role, you'll need to seek out other resources to build these skills. The aim of this book is to give an outline of the steps you can take to kick off your SOC career.
